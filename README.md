## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

Ensure that *Node.js* and the required package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm) are installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the frontend (Next.js) project:

1. Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    

2. Install frontend dependencies:

    bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    

---

### Backend Setup

This project also includes a backend built with *Node.js* and *Express, and it uses **MongoDB* as the database with *Mongoose* for ORM.

#### Prerequisites

- *Node.js*: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine (v16.8.0 or higher).
- *MongoDB*: Ensure you have MongoDB running locally or have access to a remote MongoDB instance.

#### Installation

1. Install backend dependencies:

    bash
    cd backend # Assuming the backend is in a separate directory
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    

#### Running instructions

To start the backend development server:

bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

The backend server will run on a separate port (usually http://localhost:8000), and it will be connected to the MongoDB database.

Alternatively, if you want to run it using nodemon for auto-reloading during development:

bash

nodemon index.js

This command starts the backend server and watches for file changes, automatically restarting the server.
## Additional Requirements or Dependencies

### Dependencies

This project uses the following key dependencies:

#### Frontend

- *Next.js*: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- *next/font*: Automatically optimizes and loads Geist, a custom font family by Vercel.

#### Backend

- *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
- *Express*: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server logic.
- *Mongoose*: MongoDB ODM (Object Document Mapper) to interact with MongoDB.

All dependencies are listed in the package.json files for both the frontend and backend. To add new dependencies, run:

bash
npm install <package-name> --save
# or
yarn add <package-name>
# or
pnpm add <package-name>


## Assumptions Made During Development

- *Default Styling*: Assumes either Tailwind CSS (if used) or default Next.js CSS modules.
- *Routing*: Uses Next.js App Directory Routing for page and API routing.
- *Static Assets*: Assumes static files (images, icons, etc.) are stored in the public directory.
- *Fonts*: Utilizes Geist, a custom font by Vercel, for typography.
- *Browser Compatibility*: Designed to work with modern browsers. Older browser compatibility is not explicitly configured.
